# qgis/snapshot-2019-03-08 #

Saved 2019-03-08 snapshot QGIS project for the Poudre Information Portal.

* The files were used for the initial demonstration of the portal
prototype to the
[Poudre Runs Through It](http://prti.colostate.edu/) group on 2019-03-08.
* The good news is the new WiFi at the Tamasag conference center worked well
and QGIS was able to show the background layers
* I did not try to run the Poudre Information Portal web application
because I did not have the development environment set up on my computer.
