## Background

The Wildfires map provides information about current wildfires in the Poudre Basin.

### Active Fires

The following are specific links for Cameron Peak fire:

* [USFS Cameron Peak Fire Story Map](https://nifc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=821eb2bac47c48c69558075f21365f01) - includes animation of burn area over time

The following are useful general resources for active fires, listed alphabetically:

* [Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)](https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#l:countries;@-105.5,40.5,10z) - satellite imagery and other layers (**technical interface can be difficult to use**)
* [InciWeb Incident Information System](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/?state=08) - shows incidents as icons and then narrative and other information (**easy to use**)
* [National Interagency Fire Center](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/) - open data access (**used by Poudre Basin Information**)
	+ [Zoomed to Poudre Basin](https://maps.nwcg.gov/sa/#/%3F/%3F/40.7/-105.5/10) - fire perimeter and detections
* [NOCO ALERT](https://nocoalert.org/) - emergency alerts in Larimer County (**useful evacuation information**)
* [Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center](https://gacc.nifc.gov/rmcc/incident_info.php) - shows fires as map symbols (**other websites have more information**)
* [USDA Forest Service Active Fire Mapping Program](https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/) - national map and various resources (**many data sources but requires technical skills to use**)
* [US Forest Service - Arapahoe & Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland](https://www.facebook.com/usfsarp/) - Facebook page with videos (**daily briefings during fires**)
