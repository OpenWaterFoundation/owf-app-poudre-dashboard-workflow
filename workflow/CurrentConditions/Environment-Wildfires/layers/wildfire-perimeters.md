# Layer: Colorado Wildfire Perimeters

The Poudre Wildfires layer contains all active wildfires for the Poudre Basin.
The national layer is clipped to the Poudre Basin to limit the size of data files.

**The layer is currently being downloaded and processed.
This is being updated to use the web data directly.**
