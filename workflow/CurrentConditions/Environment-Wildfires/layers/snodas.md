# Layer: Snowpack (SNODAS)

The Snowpack (SNODAS) layer contains daily snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) estimate
for water supply basins, using data from the Snow Data Assimilation System.
Mean SWE estimates for water supply basins are useful to understand general snowpack conditions.
SNODAS is useful because it provides data in locations without SNOTEL.
Use the [CDSS SNODAS Tools website](https://snodas.cdss.state.co.us/app/index.html) for more information,
including graphs of snow conditions over time and estimates of snow coverage.

See also the ***Current Conditions / Water Supply - Snowpack*** information.
