# SupportingData #

This folder contains folders for supporting data maps and layers.
These products are not visible in the InfoMapper but provide files that
are included in other maps.
For example, the Continental Divide layer group and corresponding layer are included in
multiple maps but do not have a dedicated "Basin Entities" or other map that highlights the layer.
Therefore, create a map in this folder with configuration and layer markdown file that
can be referenced via path configuration properties or copied to other maps.

See the README files in each folder for more information about a specific product.
