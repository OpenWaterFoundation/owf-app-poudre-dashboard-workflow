## Overview

The Poudre Ditch Service Area layers have been created for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)
in order to estimate irrigation consumptive use for modeling.
See also the ***Historical Data / Agriculture - Irrigated Lands*** map for detailed crop data.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Ditch Service Area layers | [CDSS Spatial Datasets for Colorado Water Districts and Divisions](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/co/cdss-data-spatial-bybasin/) Open Water Foundation datasets, which were processed from [Colorado's Decision Support Systems GIS Data by Category - Irrigation Ditches](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category). |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to process the data can be found in the
[Poudre Basin Information GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-poudre/tree/master/workflow/BasinEntities/Agriculture-Ditches).
