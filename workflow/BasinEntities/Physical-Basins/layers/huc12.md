# Layer:  HUC12 Basins

The HUC12 Basins layer contains data for Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basins
from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
HUC basins are often used when working with hydrologic and environmental data.
This layer contains 12-digit HUC sub-basins within the 8-digit HUC Cache la Poudre Basin.
