# Layer:  HUC2 Basins

The HUC2 Basins layer contains data for Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basin
from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
HUC basins are often used when working with hydrologic and environmental data.
This 2-digit basin (Missouri Region) contains the 8-digit Cache la Poudre Basin.
