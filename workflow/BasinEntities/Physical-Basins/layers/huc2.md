# Layer:  HUC2 Basins

The HUC2 Basins layer contains data for Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basins
from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
HUC basins are often used when working with hydrologic and environmental data.
This 2-digit HUC basin (Missouri Region) contains the 8-digit HUC Cache la Poudre Basin.
