# Layer: Colorado Water Provider Boundaries (DOLA)

The Colorado Water Provider Boundaries (DOLA) layer contains boundaries for
municipal water provider service areas.
The dataset is from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA),
from water and sanitation districts.

This layer must be merged with other layers to provide a complete list of
municipal water providers.
