# Layer: Colorado Water Provider Boundaries

The Colorado Water Provider Boundaries layer contains boundaries for
municipal water provider service areas,
for water providers included in the analysis.

This layer was created by the Open Water Foundation by merging data from
original sources indicated below.

**The layer is incomplete because boundaries for some water providers,
in particular municipal utilities and private companies,
must be acquired individually and is an ongoing process.**

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:
