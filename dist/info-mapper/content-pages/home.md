# Poudre Basin Information Portal (Prototype) #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this
website to provide access to cross-jurisdictional datasets for the Poudre Basin,
to understand Poudre Basin water resources issues for different temporal and spatial extents.
The information products are intended to support education,
support collaboration, and inform decision-making.

The initial target audience is the
[Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/).
However, it is envisioned that the website will be used for education,
operational support for water entities, and public access.

The same topic (e.g., streamflow) may be represented in multiple menus and maps,
each with a different perspective and context.
Standard visualization tools such as maps and graphs are being implemented
to provide simple access to data and information.
The website design leans toward simple thematic maps, each with a small number of related layers,
rather than a single map with many layers.
This allows the information products to focus on a specific topic.

Use the navigation bar at the top to select maps, visualizations, and other information products.

### **This website is under development.  Currently, menus are an outline for features that are being phased in over time.**
