## Introduction ##

Water supply from snow melt is the primary source of surface water in Colorado.
The "snowpack" is the accumulation of snow from multiple snow events that occur during cold months,
and serves as a natural water supply reservoir.
The snowpack melts in the spring and summer, with rapid melt typically occurring over 2-3 weeks in early to mid-summer.
Some snowpack melt water flows into streams, which results in a rapid increase of water supply and may at times cause flooding,
and other melt water seeps through the ground and provides year-long base flows in streams.

## Data Resources ##

The following are useful snowpack data resources.
Integrated maps will be added to the Poudre Basin Information website in the future.

* [Colorado's Decision Support Systems SNODAS](http://snodas.cdss.state.co.us/app/index.html) - snowpack for water supply basins

## Dust on Snow ##

Dust on snow can have a significant impact on the rate of snow melt.
See the following resources:

* [Colorado Dust-on-snow Program](http://www.codos.org/)
* ["Dust on Snow Controls Springtime River Rise in West"](https://www.weathernationtv.com/news/dust-snow-controls-springtime-river-rise-west/#.WnDKkmHsc6I.twitter)

## Climate Change ##

Climate change impacts, including changing the location, amount, and timing of snowpack accumulation and melt.
See the following resources for climate and snow:

* [Intermountain West Climate Dashboard from Western Water Assessment](https://wwa.colorado.edu/climate/dashboard.html)

## Impact of Wildfires ##

Wildfires impact snowpack accumulation and melt.  For example, less forest canopy allows sunlight to more directly shine on snowpack.
More information will be added here in the future.  See other resources above.
