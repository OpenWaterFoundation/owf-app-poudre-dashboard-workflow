# About the Poudre Basin Information Portal Project #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.
OWF founder and CEO, Steve Malers, has worked for years to develop water resources tools such as
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss),
and recently [OpenCDSS](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/),
which is the open source initiative for CDSS software tools.
Steve also serves on the 
[Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/)
and the [Fort Collins Water Board](https://www.fcgov.com/cityclerk/water).
Through this experience, Steve recognized that there is a need for information tools at the basin level
that integrate public data in a cross-jurisdictional, map-based format.
This website is OWF's effort to implement such tools.

The Poudre Basin Information Portal project provides access to cross-jurisdictional
datasets and visualizations for the Poudre Basin,
integrating datasets from various entities in the basin and providing
links to additional datasets and resources.
The information is intended to provide context for historical, current,
and future conditions so that residents and decision-makers in the basin
can better understand the often complex relationships between water-related topics.

This website and content published on the website use the following software:

* [Info Mapper](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-info-mapper-ng) - OWF open source map-based information tool
* [GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/) - OWF open source spatial data processing tool built on QGIS
* [TSTool](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/) - OpenCDSS software to process time series into useful products

### **This website is under development.  OWF uses its own resources for research and development and is seeking additional funding to develop open source software tools that can be applied to the Poudre and scaled to any river basin.**
