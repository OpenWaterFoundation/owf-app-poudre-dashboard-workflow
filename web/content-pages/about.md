# About the Poudre Basin Information Website #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this website.
The [Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group (PRTI)](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/) is an initial collaborator
and seeks to "make the Poudre River the world's best example of a healthy, working river".
It is envisioned that the website will be used for education,
operational support for water entities, and public access.

The Open Water Foundation is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.

This website and content published on the website use the following open source software:

* [InfoMapper](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user) - OWF open source map-based information tool
* [GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/) - OWF open source spatial data processing tool built on QGIS
* [TSTool](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/) - OpenCDSS software to process time series into useful products

This website is under development.  OWF uses its own resources for research and development and is
seeking additional funding to develop open source software tools and open datasets that
can be applied to the Poudre and other river basins.
