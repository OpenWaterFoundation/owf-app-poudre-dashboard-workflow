# About the Poudre Basin Information Website #

The Poudre Basin Information website provides access to cross-jurisdictional
datasets and visualizations for the Cache la Poudre River Basin in Northern Colorado,
integrating datasets from various entities in the basin and providing
links to additional datasets and resources.
The website menus provide information as follows:

| **Menu** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| ***Basin Entities*** | "Lay of the land" to understand the entities and programs that exist and operate in the basin, as well as important concepts.  Map layers are used on other maps on the website, as appropriate. |
| ***Historical Data*** | Historical context to help understand magnitudes and trends for various indicators and conditions. | 
| ***Current Conditions*** | Situational awareness for current water-related conditions. |
| ***Seasonal Outlook*** | Seasonal outlook to help plan for the next year. |
| ***Future Planning*** | Information to help with planning and future-proofing. |

The information can help people and organizations understand the often complex
relationships between water-related topics in order to implement sustainable and resilient solutions.

The website is developed and maintained by the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org),
which is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.
OWF founder and CEO, Steve Malers, serves on the 
[Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/),
which is working to "make the Poudre River the world's best example of a healthy, working river".
This website is also intended to support education, operations, and decision-making.

This website and content published on the website use the following software:

* [InfoMapper](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user) - OWF open source map-based information tool
* [GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/) - OWF open source spatial data processing tool built on QGIS
* [TSTool](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/) - OpenCDSS software to process time series into useful products

**This website is under development.  OWF uses its own resources for research and development and is
seeking additional funding to develop open source software tools and open datasets that
can be applied to the Poudre and other river basins.**
