# Poudre Basin Information #

The Poudre Basin Information website provides access to cross-jurisdictional
information for the
Cache la Poudre River Basin located in Northern Colorado (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_la_Poudre_River)
and [Cache la Poudre Watershed](https://www.poudrewatershed.org/cache-la-poudre-watershed)).
This website helps people and organizations efficiently find information and datasets
in order to understand complex
water-related problems and implement sustainable and resilient solutions.

Information is presented as maps, visualizations, and narrative content.
This website integrates datasets from various entities in the basin and provides
links to additional datasets and resources.

Use the navigation menu at the top to select maps, visualizations, and other information products, organized as shown in the following table.
Click on the information "i" icons for maps and layers to view documentation and data sources.

| **Menu** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| ***Basin Entities*** | "Lay of the land" to understand the entities and programs that exist and operate in the basin, as well as important concepts.  Map layers are used in other maps where appropriate. |
| ***Historical Data*** | Historical context to help understand magnitudes and trends for various indicators and conditions. | 
| ***Current Conditions*** | Situational awareness for current water-related conditions. |
| ***Seasonal Outlook*** | Seasonal outlook to help plan for the remaining year and near future. |
| ***Future Planning*** | Information to help with longer-term planning and future-proofing. |
| ***Resources*** | Additional information and documentation. |

A topic (e.g., streamflow) may be represented in multiple menus and maps,
each with a different context and time scale.
Standard visualization tools such as maps and graphs are being implemented
to provide simple access to data and information.

The website design leans toward simple thematic maps, each with a small number of related layers,
rather than a single map with many layers.
This allows the information products to focus on a specific topic.

Links open new tabs to view additional information.
Additional maps and visualizations will be added based on feedback and available data.

**This website is under development.  Menus that are disabled are an outline for features that will be phased in over
time as funding is acquired for dataset and website development.**
