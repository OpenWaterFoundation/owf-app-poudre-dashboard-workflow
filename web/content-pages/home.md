# Poudre Basin Information #

This website provides data and information for the
[Cache la Poudre River Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_la_Poudre_River),
located in Northern Colorado.

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this
website to provide access to cross-jurisdictional datasets and information products for the Poudre Basin,
to understand water resources issues for different topics, with temporal and spatial perspectives.
The information products support learning, dialogue, collaboration, and decision-making.

The website is being developed in collaboration with the
[Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/).
However, it is envisioned that the website will be used for education,
operational support for water entities, and public access.

A topic (e.g., streamflow) may be represented in multiple menus and maps,
each with a different perspective and context.
Standard visualization tools such as maps and graphs are being implemented
to provide simple access to data and information.
The website design leans toward simple thematic maps, each with a small number of related layers,
rather than a single map with many layers.
This allows the information products to focus on a specific topic.
Additional maps and visualizations will be added based on feedback that is received.

Use the navigation menu at the top to select maps, visualizations, and other information products.
Click on the information "i" icons to view documentation about maps, layer groups, and layers.

**This website is under development.  Menus that are disabled are an outline for features that will be phased in over
time as funding is acquired for development.**

and [InfoMapper software repository issues](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-infomapper-ng/issues) for a list of work backlog.
